# Overview
Datapanels is an application for displaying a rotating set of independent panels, each of which displays
some useful or entertaining information or something visually interesting. 

# Usage
After installation, the application can be run using

```
python -m datapanels.app [--builder_path path_to_builder_file] [--transition-sec secs]
```

The --builder_path option lets you specify a configuration file that will determine what panels get displayed.  
The --transition-sec parameter lets you specify the number of seconds between transitions. If no parameters are
provided, a simple default set of panels will be created.

# Configuring Datapanels
