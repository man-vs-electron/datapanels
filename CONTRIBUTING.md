# Contributing

This application is intended to be a set of independent data visualization 
panels. This is amenable to multiple independent contributors.  Contributions 
are welcome via merge requests.  New panels should be added via it own python 
file inside the datapanels package.  For example, the stock display is in 
datapanels.stockpanel.

Issues posted in the issues tracker are also welcome.

Generally usable widgets that are written in support of panels in this
application are welcome in the kwidgets library.
